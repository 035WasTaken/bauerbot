		message.channel.send('A distant humming filled the empty streets of the old, abandoned city, singing an old tune from hundreds of years before. The deep footsteps in thick, heavy snow made a soft thud that echoed across the otherwise silent, lifeless streets, rebounding from window to window. A bright light came from the hand of the man who made these noises, coming from an old, rusty flashlight, tightly strapped to his revolver, which made a small path through the seemingly infinite black ink of darkness, lighting up whatever lied in front of it. The man was hardly visible in the overcasting shadow of night; the only noticeable features being his tall, muscular build, and his menacing cape, which dangled down to the ground, sliding slowly across the snow, alongside a large, dark hood, that hid anything   that could have been seen on his face, even in the darkness. He looked like an adventurer, an explorer, someone who was searching for some unknown treasure he desired, but it was very clear that, if one could see the mans face under his secretive hood and the shroud of darkness, he had a destination in mind. He didn’t have the look of a mercenary, though he wore similar clothing. The look in his eyes proved otherwise: he was set on something, a goal, a mission, a destiny, and to him, there was no wall he couldn’t climb that would stop him from reaching that destiny.');
	  	message.channel.send('He walked into an old subway station, the walls rusted by time, yellowed and dusty, falling apart and peeling. One of the walls had crumbled down, leaving nothing but the metal supports and the frame behind it, of which had rusted, some of it collapsed. The station was fragile, it had seen countless years and countless battles. There was a massive door blocking his entry to the station, it’s metal somewhat clean and well kept, unlike the rest of the station, and it was tied together by a mix of bolts, screws, and tape. On the middle there was a large insignia: a red rectangle with three white swords; the flag of the Republic. It appeared crude, but it served it’s purpose. He put his gun quickly into his holster, turning off its flashlight, then raised his hand and pounded it on the door.');
    		message.channel.send('The door began to creak, dust and frosted snow coming out of it as the gate opened. The lights inside were almost blinding compared to the darkness that remained outside the station, and the shadow of a man, clearly a guard of the station, was cast down on the adventurer, openly pointing his double-barrel shotgun at him.');
    		message.channel.send('"What are you doin’ here, old man?" the guard said in a very serious manner, speaking in a voice so deep it almost seemed fake, almost as though he was trying to assert dominance over the adventurer.');
    		message.channel.send('"I am on official business with the Aeternum Republic, here to see Doctor Cassius Devitt," the man replied swiftly and sharply.');
    		message.channel.send('"The Plague Doctor? What for? Who sent you?" the guard responded with anger, believing the adventurer was nothing more than a fake and a liar. He responded with nothing, instead pulling a small piece of paper out of his pocket, gesturing it towards the guard. He took it fiercely with one hand, keeping the other on the shotgun pointed at the man, acting as though he were about to rip the sheet in half. The guard stared at the paper for a moment, then looked up from the paper directly at the adventurer, then back down at the paper. He growled angrily, clearly showing his teeth, and frowned at the man.');
    		message.channel.send('“Authority to see the Doctor from the Executor himself… fine. Come with me,” the guard handed the adventurer back his paper, who then proceeded to put it back into his pocket. The guard held his shotgun at his side and began to walk the man through the station.');
    		message.channel.send('“You’re the first man to come see him in a while. He might not be so… sociable,” the guard explained to him, looking forward, keeping his eyes off the adventurer out of hatred, possibly even out of fear.');
    		message.channel.send('“I’ve dealt with worse.”');
    		message.channel.send('“If you don’t mind me asking, what business do are you here to see him about?”');
    		message.channel.send('“I do mind you asking.”');
    		message.channel.send('People were somewhat scarce at the station, most appeared to only be passing through, coming onto the platform itself to make their way into the tunnel on the opposite side, or to trade with one of the very few salesmen who made a living off of the trade there. There was one of these that caught the adventurer’s eye for a moment: a man standing behind one of these market stands, middle aged and in a bad state of health, with a large scar coming down from the top of his forehead all the way to the top of his lip, completely covering one eye and rendering it useless. Two guards appeared in front of his stand suddenly, both with large guns drawn. They began screaming at the old man, but the old man almost completely ignored them.');
    		message.channel.send('“…if you don’t pay up right now… we have orders on the behalf of the Republic to seize tax…” the guards shouted at him. Much to their surprise, the old man came back with just the same force, but his was not shown in words. Instead, he reached under his cabinet for something. The guards most likely thought it was the money he had to pay, but the old man would much rather die than let the guards take from him again.');
    		message.channel.send('Like a quick flash of light, he whipped out a pistol and killed one of the guards in front of him, square in between the eyes. A good shot for a man his age. He took the gun and pointed it at the other and pulled the trigger. An empty click. The remaining guard simply laughed at the old man, and raised his gun at him. The adventurer turned away quickly, as in spite of all the things he had seen, he still couldn’t stand to see a poor old man suffer such a fate as this. The gunshot thundered across the station, echoing across it’s aging halls and into the tunnels.');
    		message.channel.send('The adventurer clenched his fist in anger, wishing he could reach for his pistol and do just as the old man had done, but he knew that there was no way he would be able to get out alive if he did something as stupid as that. Then again, he was about to meet Cassius face to face, for the first time in years, how would he survive something like that? The man could only vaguely remember his first time meeting the doctor, thinking only of the menacing plague doctor helmet that he had so ingeniously made into a respirator.');
		message.channel.send('How many years ago had that been? Three? It had been fourteen years since he had fled the Constanti Academy, but he didn’t count that as meeting him. Both the adventurer himself and the crazed doctor had changed too much for events that long ago to matter anymore. Had it been three years? Only three? It had felt like an eternity, but to him time had become beyond comprehension. It was hard to keep track of time during the war, and events sped past him, running away into the deep pits of his mind, hiding behind old, fragmented memories, torn apart by time. Whenever the adventurer tried to think too hard, to remember what Cassius looked like or sounded like, the memory completely vanished, the only thing left behind being his sinister laugh, made metallic by the thick gas he wore. ');
		message.channel.send('He rolled up the sleeve of his coat briefly on his right arm and looked at his wrist. The numbers still remained: 7935, and though the burned mark had been heavily decayed with time, it was still easily readable. The numbers didn’t mean that he was the 7935th to go through with the procedure, only that he was the 7935th one to go into the doctor’s “care”. Care meant almost anything to Cassius, from replacing a limb with a robotic one, to disassembling someone simply to study them; to see how they worked.');
		message.channel.send('How did he even manage to escape that hellish place? The adventurer shook his head quickly, as to force the ideas out of his mind. The pains he withheld during those five hours were the worst of his life, and the tears that were ripped open healed only to scars, of which could never be truly fixed. Five hours of hell left a mark on his mind that endless years of peace would never be able restore. It wasn’t like that mattered, though: peace would never come for him, and he knew that and had accepted it long ago.');
		message.channel.send('The adventurer and his escort arrived at the end of the hall, at a large, rusted metal door, with no windows or possible ways of seeing out. Two white robed guards with black masks stood at each side of the door, each holding a similarly painted shotgun, aimed towards the ground, held in both hands. They looked much more formal and professional than the scrapped-armor covered soldiers that roamed the streets. The guards raised their guns silently towards the adventurer and his escort.');
		message.channel.send('“At ease!” his escort put his hand up, signaling the guards to lower their weapons, though they did not, “He’s here to see Cassius, he has orders, from the Executor.” He gestured for the adventurer to give them the sheet of paper he held, and he did so. The left hand guard walked up and snatched it out of his hand, staring at it with eyes that couldn’t be seen behind the immense, black mask. The guard nodded, putting the paper in his pocket, and opened the door, letting the adventurer through without a word.');
		message.channel.send('The room that stood before him was black and empty, even darker than the night that awaited him outside the station. Soon, the bright light from behind him began to dissipate: someone had closed the door. The door gave a loud thud as it finally shut, trapping the adventurer inside with the doctor. The adventurer removed his hood and took out his revolver.');
		message.channel.send('“Cassius, old friend, it has been a while hasn’t it?” he said, looking around the room, hoping to see something out of the darkness. A deep, heavy, metallic breathing began to come from what appeared to be the back of the room. A small light appeared behind the place where the breathing was coming from, illuminating a tall, menacing figure. A deep and heavy laugh followed, a laugh that had haunted the dreams- well, nightmares- of the adventurer for years.');
		message.channel.send('“Adrian Bauer? Your courage inspires me, yet your idiocracy makes me cringe,” the doctor said, at last revealing his metallic voice to the adventurer, “You could have been quite a fine soldier, you know? All I needed to do was make a handful of… adjustments.”');
		message.channel.send('“Torture and partial brain removal? You’re a sociopath,” Adrian spoke calmly, yet his shaking arms and sweating palms said otherwise. Cassius simply sighed, letting loose an almost robotic exhale.');
		message.channel.send('“The shadow of what could have been haunts over me still, you know. I’ve tried to forget the name, truthfully. Adrian Bauer. He died as he left the Constanti Academy. All you could have been, gone and dead. Quite a shame.”');
		message.channel.send('“I don’t regret any of it.”');
		message.channel.send('“Really? Not even after what happened to Anna?”');
		message.channel.send('“If I hadn’t left, you would have made me murder her with my own hands,” Adrian clenched his fist tighter, the bringing up of his mother, especially her death, brought upon him nothing but hatred for the man he spoke with.');
		message.channel.send('“Perhaps, but a good, loyal soldier would be willing to do such a thing. And I assure you, I could have made you loyal. Perhaps I still can?” the Doctor said, laughing again as he tapped a button he held in his hand, and a set of bright lights turned on, one in each corner of the hellish laboratory. However, the adventurer wished the lights could remain off: the sights would be enough to haunt him for the rest of his days.');
		message.channel.send('The walls were plain white, in somewhat good condition,aside from the immense stains of blood. Scratch marks from desperate “patients” drained of all hope, with nothing more than the wish to escape, but well knowing that that wish would never come true. The more the adventurer looked around the room, the more he realized that the blood had almost left no surface untouched. In the middle of the room stood an operating table, with a man, presumably dead, lying with his back up on it. The patient wore pants and shoes, but he did not have his shirt on, instead his back was laid open, with a massive scar climbing across it, cutting in so deep that it revealed his spine. There were numerous wires and cables connected to the spine, as well as metal braces that connected the spine to these wires. The man’s head was shaved bald, with the left half of his head cut open, revealing his brain, with another large brace connecting the patient’s mind to another set of wires. All the wires, both from the spine and the brain, connected to a small battery, no larger than a man’s hand and no heavier than maybe a dozen pounds, which was attached to the patient’s leg. A small piece of a cloth tarp covered the right arm of the poor man, and numerous wires from the battery, spine, and brain went under the tarp to his hand.');
		message.channel.send('The adventurer couldn’t take his eyes off the patient, not because of awe, but because of dread and a deep feeling of utter hopelessness. Despite this, he tightened his grip on his revolver and prepared to shoot. The Doctor stood behind the table where he worked on his cyborg menace, and he was just as the adventurer remembered him: a tall figure, wearing a pitch black set of bulletproof armor and blood stained, white doctor gloves, and his face was completely hidden by a spotlessly white plague doctor’s mask, with a number of tubes coming out of it, onto a small respirator near his chest, which was, like the rest of the doctor, coated in armor. His armor and clothes were stained dark red with the blood of his patients.');
		message.channel.send('“Beautiful isn’t it?” the madman let loose his metallic laugh once more, then looked at the, “I do apologize for the… mess. Had I known you were coming, Mr. Bauer, I would have prepared myself accordingly.” The Doctor glanced briefly at the adventurer’s pistol, then back up at the grim, horrified look on his face. The adventurer was scowling angrily, looking like he was about to tear someone in half, his fists were clenched, one around his revolver, the other around nothing but misty air, yet still he did not shoot the doctor.');
		message.channel.send('“Do not worry, Mr. Brauer, he came willingly. We promised him immortality, a life without fear and pain, in return for only a lifetime of service to the Republic! It sounds like a wonderful offer,” the doctor’s voice was bright and happy, yet still menacing, but it suddenly deepened as he told the man, “We didn’t lie to him, really. We just… didn’t tell him some of the lesser things that might occur after the surgery.”');
		message.channel.send('Adrian watched the doctor closely as he walked towards a wall with a very large scratch mark and ran his hand along it, “Once he heard about the true process of the surgery- transformation I should call it, really. A normal surgery works to fix something, change something. My surgery, my… transformation… works to make one perfect. But I’m getting off track,” Cassius laughed lightly as he continues his story, “Once he had heard about the real process of the transformation, he did his very best in an attempt to escape. We slaughtered his attempt, but,” the Doctor traced his hand across the large scar on the wall once more, “his attempt did come at a cost to us, and to him. His personality was broken, he could never be truly fixed. He could never be the same as he was before the transformation, and I made sure of that. Besides the normal removal of the amygdala, I also removed and damaged a large section, of the frontal lobe- specifically to destroy his personality. He acts like an ape, almost, yet more sophisticated, almost like a mercenary. But you know what I didn’t remove? Hatred. And all I need to do in order to turn enable this hatred,” the Doctor reached into his pocket and pulled out a small device, and flicked a button on it, “is press a button.”');
		message.channel.send('The adventurer backed away from the Doctor and his patient. The patient began to rise slowly, first putting his hand, the one not covered by cloth, onto the bed and pushing himself up. He took his right leg and raised it to stand, then got up into the other, leaving himself to crouch with one hand on the table. He stood up fully, with his back to the adventurer, but slowly turned to face him and jump off the table, standing right in front of him and stared him in the eyes. The eyes of the patient were unblinking, nor did they ever disconnect themselves from the eyes of the adventurer.');
		message.channel.send('“What is this? What have you-”');
		message.channel.send('“A patient, Mr. Bauer. One of my proudest creations, only below Cassia.”');
		message.channel.send('**‘This isn’t a creation, it’s a monstrosity!”**');
		message.channel.send('“A monstrosity, please! Mr. Bauer, I taught you to be a gentlemen, now show the respect you’ve learned!” the Doctor said, laughing as he looked over to Adrian, who simply glared silently, the same look of hatred on his face.');
		message.channel.send('“Now, I am dearly sorry, Mr. Bauer, but I am afraid I won’t be able to let you leave this place. If the Rebellion got word of this, why, the Executor would give me hell!” he laughed again, likely giving some menacing grin from before. Adrian raised his arm to shoot his pistol, but before he could shoot, the patient grabbed him by the neck with his completely robotic left hand, choking and holding him above the ground, his fist like a clamp. In a last attempt for life, he shot his pistol, rapidly and randomly. Six loud bangs, all of which echoed throughout the halls, each of them missing the creation and it’s maker. The adventurer gagged for a breath, hoping to keep consciousness, but to no avail. He felt his head getting heavy, and felt himself collapse as the robotic hand finally let him go. Yet even after he was able to breath, his vision still faded to black.');
		message.channel.send('“Put him with the others,” he could hear the Plague Doctor say as he finally failed himself, and let himself into the darkness of unconsciousness.');
		message.channel.send('Adrian’s eyes opened slowly, blinking rapidly as they did, trying to clear his blurred vision from the blood, sweat, and tears. He was lying in a small, rusted room with a bulky looking metal door. The only light in the room came from it’s small cracks and hinges, giving him just enough light to see the few things closest to the door. He was still in his hooded clothes, however they were ragged and torn, with a large scar protruding through his jeans, showing a massive cut. But how did it get there? It must have happened while he was unconscious. The man shook his head, trying to let his thoughts out of his clotted brain. What was going on? The first thing that came to his mind as soon as he had woken up was pain: a massive scar running along his left calf, his neck still tight, only allowing for an occasional, painful breath.');
		message.channel.send('He slowly tried to stand up, though he was hardly able; with his right leg holding the majority of his weight, leaving everything else to be carried by his left, causing it immense, unbearable pain. He felt for his holster, hoping that his one chance of escape would still be there, but all he felt was the empty, dense air. No gun, no knife, no hope; that was the world he lived in. His legs collapsed under him, dropping him onto the hard, dusty concrete floor. The pain in his leg flared up again, and the man winced in pain. He sat up and looked at the scar, trying to make out the damage with the little rays of light. The scar was deeper than he had seen before, and it was bleeding immensely. He quickly ripped off the little piece left of his cape and wrapped it around the scar in an effort to stop the blood gushing out of it. Why was there so little left of the cape? It had been glorious, flowing down unto the ground. Where had it all gone? The thought crossed the adventurer’s mind, but he disregarded it, considering it to be unimportant, and he laid back down in an attempt to ease the pain, to let his wound heal as he waited.');
		message.channel.send('Adrian closed his eyes and became encased in his thought again. “How did I get here, what had I done wrong?” Adrian closed his eyes and became encased in his thought again, mumbling them aloud to keep himself awake, “Should have shot the bastard as soon as I…”');
		message.channel.send('He ceased his mumbling, deciding that it was better for anyone that might have been watching or listening not to hear. The adventurer’s thoughts immediately drifted off to ideas of escape: how, where, when? They soared through the man’s mind, but none of them seemed to stick, be it because of his brain’s constant blackouts that still occasionally occurred, or because any legitimate plans that did come to his mind were quickly deemed impossible. The man lay, crumpled up, in almost complete hopelessness, simply awaiting whatever fate was to now come his way, praying for little more than death. Fate, on the other hand, had no intent of giving him a quick death.');
		message.channel.send('A loud knocking came from the door, but Adrian refused to stand or even pay attention to the knocking, instead letting himself be embraced by darkness and hopelessness. The knock came a few more times, and after discovering that his knocks were not disturbing the adventurer, whoever was outside knocking spoke. ');
		message.channel.send('“Head Doctor Cassius wants to speak with you. You can comply, or be hung as a sentence from the Council of the Republic,” the soldier spoke through a tiny gap in the door. The adventurer sat up, bringing more pain to his scar, and said to the soldier with the little strength he had left, “Let him speak with me.” The wishes of death had left his mind; the only way to escape his captors would to negotiate with them, which, at worst, would at least prolong his life for another few hours.');
		message.channel.send('The door slowly creaked open, and the light blared through and blinded the adventurer, who immediately put his hand in front of his eyes in order to shield them. The door hit the wall with a thud, and the loud, echoing sound of the Doctor’s metallic boots came closer. The doctor walked inside and leaned himself against the wall, “My my, Adrian, you seem injured,” he said as he stared down at the man, taking notice to the hidden scar on his leg.');
		message.channel.send('“I guess A049 decided it wouldn’t be enough to simply leave you here… apologies.” The Doctor’s eyes were hidden behind his mask, shiny pieces of glass letting him see out but not the adventurer in, instead the adventurer saw only himself in the reflection, only his eyes, filled with a hellish, burning hatred that overshadowed over even the deep, eternal fear.');
		message.channel.send('“Why are you meeting with me? Why not just kill me?” the man grunted in the strongest voice he could muster, risking his fate, again wandering over to a wish for nothing more than death. ');
		message.channel.send('“Kill you?”, the Doctor laughed heartily at the man, letting loose a metallic roar that echoed in the cell, “No, no, that is… too good a fate for you. Death… too simple.”');
		message.channel.send('“Then what are you going to do with me, you bastard!?” the man spat at the Doctor in anger and fear, as he let free his metallic laugh once more. The Doctor kneeled on one knee in front of the man, staring right into his eyes, almost letting the beak of his mask touch his nose, saying, “That’s classified. You’ll see eventually, but for now? I am the one asking the questions,” he backed up from the adventurer and began pacing around the room. “');
		message.channel.send('Now,” the Doctor said calmly as he took out a large needle from his pocket, “how did you get the note from the Executor? I managed to contact him a few hours ago, and I was told that he had no knowledge of that paper.”');
		message.channel.send('“That’s none of your business you-”');
		message.channel.send('“Ah ah ah, language. Now I am afraid that if you refuse to comply,” the Doctor places the syringe near the adventurer’s arm, “we will be forced to… destroy you, just like we did A049. Make you forget everything but hatred and despair. You don’t want that, now do you?”');
		message.channel.send('“For you to make more monsters?”');
		message.channel.send('“Monsters?” Cassius asked, taken back by the question, “They are not monsters, they are creations of science! Works of genius! Mr. Bauer, realize that I am not an inhumane man. Anything I do works towards the good of science, towards the good of my people! I am a family man, you know. I have a wonderful wife and the sweetest little girl. What do you have? A sad little home in Seditionem Ventum”');
		message.channel.send('“Who would marry you? A psychopath?” he chose not to answer the question because he knew he was right.');
		message.channel.send('“She was a good woman, really. It’s a shame she passed. But life goes on, does it not? And I assure you, Mr. Bauer, my work goes to make sure it does.”');
		message.channel.send('“You call this life? What you create isn’t-”');
		message.channel.send('He was cut short as there was a loud banging coming from outside the door: another soldier, knocking to get the Doctor. “Sorry to bother you sir, but there’s a uh… situation,” the soldier said. There was a short moment of silence, where the man, whose senses were at last coming to and his hearing becoming as sharp as it usually was, could here distant screams and the roars of gunfire, as well as loud, metallic footsteps, coming constantly closer, like an old army in steel boots. “What do you mean a situation!?” the Doctor stopped pacing and went to the soldier at the door, “The rebels, or whatever the hell they call themselves, taking the station by storm. We have them blocked them off at the second airlock, but it won’t last long. We’re outnumbered, sir,” the soldier spoke excitedly, and there was a definite look of fear in his eyes.');
		message.channel.send('The Doctor quickly put away his syringe and took out a pistol from his holster, “I am sorry, Mr. Bauer, but it looks like our time together has come to a close,” he pointed the gun at the adventurer’s chest, and as the distant sound of gunfire continued to grow near, he fired the gun, catching him in the side of his chest; a painful strike, but not a lethal one if it was treated correctly. Pain shot around the man’s body, making him feel as though he was being torn into shreds from the inside out. His vision blurred, and the echoing, deep sound of the revolver’s shot filled his ears. His eyes began to tear up, but through what he could still see he saw the soldier and the Doctor exiting the cell, and could hear them talking, though he was not able to decipher what it was they were saying. The gunshots came closer and closer, clearly following the Doctor, but soon came to a close, and all that remained were the metallic footsteps.');
		message.channel.send('A few of the rebel fighters walked past the cell, and the adventurer tried to call out to them, but his cries were too quiet and weak. He began to slowly close his eyes, accepting his fate, his death. Then the footsteps came astonishingly close to him, and he could see an outline of a tall man in military armor standing in front of him, trying to get his attention. Leave me alone, let me die, the man thought, but to no avail. He could see the figure gesture towards his friends, and heard a loud yell, saying, “He’s still alive, here! Someone get a doctor!” The adventure lightheartedly chuckled inside at the call for a doctor, for it was a doctor that had done this to him. He saw a few more soldiers enter the room, one, two, three, his vision was too blurred to tell anymore, and he closed his eyes in hope that he would be able to sleep as they carried him away. He felt soft, leather gloves on his shoulders and legs, which slowly picked him up and put him unto a stretcher. “Just a little gunshot wound, nothing a trip to ol’ Ainsworth won’t fix,” one of the rebels said, “But your leg… that… oh. I think that-”');
		message.channel.send('The soldier speaking stopped and shouted something, but he couldn’t understand it with his dulled senses. He was probably calling for a doctor. Adrian remembered Ainsworth, an old colleague of his, one of the head figures in the movement against the Republic. Anton Ainsworth, the thought wandered around in his head, but immediately left as he began to consider other things: What was he going to do with himself after he recovered? Return to life back in Seditionem Ventum? He couldn’t just leave the rebellion, he was one of the most important figures in it, but he didn’t wish to continue this lifestyle. He wanted nothing more than to be out of Michigan, somewhere peaceful, quiet, where he could grow old and die a simple man: a farmer, a repairman, something like that, but life wasn’t that simple.');
		message.channel.send('The sound of shoes pounding against the concrete, sprinting towards the man, became noticeably louder. He opened his eyes for a second, and saw a soldier salute a man dressed in all white, who carried a large bag in his hand. Before he could tell what it was, his vision blurred out again, and he was left with nothing but his hearing to guide him. The man in white spoke, an unrecognizable voice to the adventurer, but it spoke calmingly, saying, “Mr. Bauer, what a mess you’ve gotten yourself into. Still, nothing a few band-aids won’t heal eventually, eh?” The adventurer coughed, his throat burned from thirst, and he winced in pain yet again. The doctor reached into his pocket and pulled out a syringe filled with blue liquid, and he flinched at the sight of it, “No worries,” he said as he saw the adventurer’s movement, “just a simple procedure.” The doctor stabbed the syringe into his arm, and the adventurer’s senses began to dull, as his eyes slowly closed, and did not blink back open.');
		message.channel.send('“Alright, I think he’s waking up,” another unknown voice said. The adventurer shook his head with the little strength he had and lazily started to open his eyes. There were two figures dressed in white lab coats in front of him, but he couldn’t make out their faces with his still-blurred vision.');
		message.channel.send('“Mr. Bauer? Mr. Bauer!?” one of the doctors asked intently as he stared down at the adventurer, who began to slowly sit up from his comfortable, cloth bed. He looked around him: he was in a plain white room, which had clearly seen some damages in the past but it appeared that whoever was currently in control of this place- currently in control of him- had fixed it up quite well. Why was it so familiar? He sat up completely, his legs still outstretched upon the bed, though they were hidden under a small, white blanket, with a red lining of linen. “Where am I?” he said calmly, with an almost threatening tone, as though he would grab the necks of the doctors if they didn’t respond quickly enough. “Easy now, we’ll explain everything to you soon,” the doctor on the left said, as the one on his right walked over to a small table on the side of the room. The adventurer kicked off the blanket and stared at his leg where the scar had been. Where his calf used to be, there was a short, thick, dark silver, metal rod, with wires and circuits hanging out of it, and a long wire connecting to a metal brace that clinged to the back of his thigh.');
		message.channel.send('“What have you done to me?” the adventurer asked the doctors, very tense in his movements, now speaking openingly threateningly. “There was nothing else we could do. The cut was too deep- it had been permanently paralyzed. We wanted to leave it be, let you limp with a cast and be free of duty, but General Reynolds demanded we do, said you were “too good of an asset to lose,” the doctor said calmly, now pacing the room around the adventurer’s medical bed, “I’d take that as a compliment. God knows she’d be willing to let any of us die or get crippled and could throw it off to the side as though we were just a damned Republic soldier.” The adventurer shook his head in hatred and an acceptance of defeat, saying only, “Jane never changes, does she?”');
		message.channel.send('The two doctors chuckled slightly, and nodded their heads in agreement, as though they feared that the General would come after them herself if they said something against her. The adventurer turned his body and let his legs slide off the bed and touch the ground, sitting up. He was wearing an old, white shirt, which was mostly clean besides the occasional blood stain, and a pair of shorts which cut off just where his knee was; just where the robotic leg began. He took his hand and ran it along his new limb: the metal was cold and smooth, with nothing but one or two red wires coming out of it, connecting to a metal brace on his upper leg, and he suddenly winced at the sight of it. It was so familiar, and the memory poked at him angrily: the poor man on the operating table, turned into a machine by that clinically insane doctor, not even a fate that one of those Republic soldiers deserved. Whatever the thing was on his leg, it was not technology of the Resistance.');
		message.channel.send('“This… thing… on my leg, it’s not Cassius’ machinery, right?” the adventurer asked with a worried look on his face;  he wanted nothing that menace made to touch him, in fact he wanted nothing more than to see him lying dead. “I’m afraid it is, Mr. Bauer. It was the only technology at hand, and it was in quite good condition when we found it,” one of the doctors told him as he walked back over towards the bed and extended a hand as though to help the adventurer up. Instead of accepting his offer, he smacked the hand away with the most force he had used in days, “I’d rather be dead than have something that monster made attached to my leg!” he shouted in anger, receiving only mumbled responses from both his doctors, both saying something along the lines of, “Orders are orders”.');
		message.channel.send('The adventurer stood up out of the bed, walking on his new, robotic leg almost perfectly, though still tripping or almost falling once or twice. He looked around for a moment, then reached towards a cabinet, searching for something. “Where is it?” he said as he ripped open a cabinet. only finding some medical and robotic supplies, “Where the hell did you take it you bastards!?” He yelled at no one and nothing, screaming out in anger, searching for the one piece he had left of his mother, a short blade he had dubbed “Vengeance”, with a sharp tip and a few words engraved into the handle, “I love you and I will protect you.” The last words he heard from his mother before- he quickly shoot the memory out of his mind, and a single, small tear escaped his eye and slid down his face, dropping unto the floor. He held his hand to his face and wiped away anything left of his sadness and sprinted towards the door. It had been left wide open, but the adventurer had not gazed at it until now.');
		message.channel.send('He held his hand against the side of the door and gazed outside at the station, suddenly realizing why the room was so recognizable to him: it was the Plague Doctor’s “hospital”, the one where he created A049. There was a hand on his shoulder, coming from behind him: the doctor from before. In the other hand was a small suitcase, seemingly quite light. The hand left his shoulder as the adventurer turned to face the man, who in turn backed up a step in fear. “You have orders to return to Seditionem Ventum. Issued by General Reynolds herself,” he said cautiously, as though he were scared that he would anger the adventurer, and held out the suitcase for him to take. The adventurer took the case carefully and inspected it’s exterior thoroughly, then slowly beginning to open it. The contents of the case were somewhat limited: a black leather jacket with faded brown outlines, a small revolver filled with bullets, a pair of jeans, a gas mask, another smaller box, and two metal toed boots.');
		message.channel.send('He placed the case on the ground and took out the jacket and threw it over his shoulders, then took out the jeans and slid them on over his shorts. He slid into the shoes, put his new revolver into one of his pockets, and stared into the shiny glass eyes of the gas mask. In it he saw himself for the first time in what felt to him like years, but not the same man that he saw in the mirror the day he walked into Antonia Street Station: a deep scar ran across his face, running from his left eyebrow to the edge of his lip; he saw a man with no emotion in his eyes, no driving fire or hope, only hatred and fear: he was no longer an adventurer, but a survivor. He turned the mask around and strapped it to his face, then drew his attention to the final item in the case: a small, wooden box. He took it and showed it to the doctor, who still stood at the door, waiting, “What is this thing?” the adventurer asked him.');
		message.channel.send('The doctor simply waited and said, “Open it.” He did as he was told, and he at last found what he had been searching for, and a small hint of hope returned to his eyes. “Thank you,” the adventurer sputtered at the doctor as he tried to hide his tears. He put the blade into his opposite pocket and began to walk towards the surface.');
